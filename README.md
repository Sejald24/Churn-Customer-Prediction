Churn Customer Prediction Using Machine Learning

Highlights:
-Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify key churn factors and visualize trends using boxplots and heatmaps.
-Applied Data Preprocessing: Skewness adjustment, outlier removal (Z-scores, IQR), and feature engineering for categorical and numerical data.
-Developed and optimized models (XGBoost, SVM) with GridSearchCV, achieving 97.2% accuracy.
-Evaluated performance using confusion matrix and classification report.
-Deployed the XGBoost model using pickle for reuse in predictions.
